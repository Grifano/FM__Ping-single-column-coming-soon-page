## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML5 client-side validation
- Regular Expresions
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Grid CSS
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

Now I know how to change the focus border color. I didn't know that is done through outline-color property ðŸ˜³  
And this amazing CSS3 features like invalid pseudo-class. Where you can set up the input behavior when the user didn't provide correct data.  
I believe there are is something like a valid pseudo-class too... but let me try them in the next challenge ðŸ˜‰

```css
input:focus {
  outline-color: $primary;
}
input:invalid {
  outline-color: $lightRed;
  color: $lightRed;
}
```

I can belive that I finish that JS code so quicklyâ€¦ ðŸ¥¹
The previous one took me at least a couple of weekends... I just decided not to make them complicated. I find some new secrets. So, you can submit the form through a callback event too. And doesn't need to write form.submit() again inside the callback function into the eventListener.

```js
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  if (email.value !== "") {
    e.submit(); // instend of form.submit()
  } else {
    e.preventDefault();
    invalidMsg.className = "active";
    invalidMsg.innerText = "Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email";
  }
});
```

### Continued development

I'm focusing on improving my programming skills with HTML&CSS and JavaScript. My plan is to get comfortable with the basics before I going to dive into the Frontend framework/library like React, Angular, Vue, etc.
I hope that such amzing tools like [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), and [Uxcel](https://uxcel.com?invite=EE4PBID94EEH) help me with my this.
